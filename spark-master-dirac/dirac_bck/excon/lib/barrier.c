/* implementation of a barrier to sync threads.
  The barrier has two doors (enter and exit). Only one door 
  can be open at a time. Initially the enter door is open.
  All threads that enter the barrier are sleeping (wait).
  The last thread to enter the barrier will 
   1)close the enter door
   2)wakeup all sleeping threads.
   3)open the exit door.
  So the woken up threads will leave the barrier one by 
  one, as they are awoken. The last thread to leave the barrier
  will
   1)open the enter door 
   2)close the exit door,
  So finally the barrier reaches its initial state
